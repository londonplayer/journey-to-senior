# Module 4 (Weeks 7–8): Memory management + caches

- Resources: OSTEP; CS:APP (allocators); cache chapters.
- Outcomes: explicit free-list allocator; coalescing/splitting; cache experiments.
- Exit: allocator passes traces; cache thresholds identified; oral “malloc via brk/mmap.”
- Cross-links: allocator invariants ↔ proofs; locality ↔ asymptotics.
