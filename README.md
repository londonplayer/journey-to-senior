# My 16-Week Computer Science Fundamentals Journey

This repository documents a rigorous, 16-week self-study program to build a deep, first-principles understanding of computer science. The goal is to move beyond simply _using_ tools to fundamentally understanding _how they work_, from the physics of transistors up to distributed data systems.

This plan is a bottom-up journey with no shortcuts, emphasizing hands-on implementation, mathematical reasoning, and clear technical explanations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Objectives

- **Explain systems from first principles:** From how a bit is stored to how a distributed transaction is committed.
- **Implement small systems:** Build components like a memory allocator, a compiler front-end, a bytecode VM, and an HTTP server.
- **Reason with mathematics:** Defend performance claims, analyze complexity, and prove correctness using logic, discrete math, and probability.
- **Master the toolchain:** Understand the path from C source code to a running process, including compilation, linking, loading, and virtual memory.
