# Module 2 (Weeks 3–4): Toolchain and virtual memory

- Resources: CS:APP; System V ABI (ELF).
- Outcomes: preprocess→compile→assemble→link→load; ELF/relocations; PLT/GOT; address spaces; TLB; page faults.
- Exit: relocation report; loader tracing; oral “what happens at main().”
- Cross-links: VM paging ↔ recurrences (cost layers); ASLR ↔ security.
