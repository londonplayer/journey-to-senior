# Module 5 (Weeks 9–10): Concurrency + queueing + FP numerics

- Resources: OSTEP (concurrency); TLPI (pthreads API); Goldberg FP paper.
- Outcomes: thread pool + bounded queue; Kahan summation; rate limiter/work-stealing.
- Exit: race-free under tsan/helgrind; throughput/latency within bounds; numerics plots.
- Cross-links: Little’s law ↔ backpressure; FP error ↔ stability.
