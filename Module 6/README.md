# Module 6 (Weeks 11–12): Networking + TLS (conceptual)

- Resources: Kurose & Ross; RFC 8446 overview; RFC 9293 overview; TLPI sockets.
- Outcomes: TCP echo → HTTP/1.1 server; handshake/RTT measurement; goodput study.
- Exit: server correctness + persistence; latency report; oral “slow start/RTO.”
- Cross-links: RTT ↔ speed-of-light; BDP ↔ windowing.
