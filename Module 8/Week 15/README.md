Week 15 — Capstone kickoff; crypto basics; FP pitfalls

- Readings
  - Serious Cryptography: Ch. 1–2, 7–9 (selected). Goldberg FP Sects. 5–6.
- Labs
  - Capstone planning: choose A or B; threat model; performance metrics; FP pitfalls checklist.
    - Acceptance: written plan with testable checks; perf KPIs.
- Retrieval set 1. Confidentiality, integrity, authenticity. 2) IV/nonce uniqueness and reuse impact. 3) FP pitfalls expected in capstone. 4) Data flow with trust boundaries. 5) Plausible memory safety bugs + tests. 6) Throughput back-of-envelope. 7) Core invariant/proof obligation.
