Week 16 — Capstone finish; performance study; security review; ethics

- Readings
  - RFCs/specs for your capstone; ACM Code of Ethics.
- Labs
  - Capstone completion + perf study + security checks; 6–10 page report.
    - Acceptance: demo; reproducible benchmarks; math-backed claims; FP checklist; short security review.
- Retrieval set 1. Derive throughput/latency from measurements (apply Little’s law). 2) Tie one correctness invariant to tests. 3) Quantify FP error in a core routine. 4) One realistic threat and mitigation. 5) Limits of your system.
