# Milestones (Weeks 9–16)

- W9: Language spec, grammar, sample programs, tests scaffold.
- W10: Lexer + parser (pass valid/invalid).
- W11: AST → bytecode; VM executes arithmetic/vars.
- W12: Control flow, functions, call frames.
- W13: Diagnostics and error handling quality.
- W14: Performance pass (peephole, const folding) + profiling write-up.
- W15: Perf model vs measure; instruction mix; CPI-like metric; queueing if MT.
- W16: Security review; final tests; oral defense prep.
