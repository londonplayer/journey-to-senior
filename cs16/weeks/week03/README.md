# Week 03 — CPU Integration, Assembler, Graphs; Digital Timing Micro-lab

Resources
- Nand2Tetris: Ch. 5–6 (CPU, Assembler), skim Ch. 7 (VM I)
- 6.042J: Ch. 10.1–10.3 (graphs: BFS/DFS)

Outcomes
- Implement Hack CPU; write assembler.
- Measure propagation delays; understand critical path.
- Prove BFS shortest paths; runtime bounds.

Exit Criteria
- CPU and assembler pass tests; timing micro-lab report.

Retrieval Bank
1) Carry out of bit i depends only on lower i+1 bit-pairs (prove).
2) Invariant for assembler symbol table pass.
3) Bound max clock freq from gate depth L and delay δ.
4) BFS correctness for unweighted shortest paths.
5) Stack VM translation and stack height bound.
