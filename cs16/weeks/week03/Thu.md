# Week 03 — Thu 6–9 pm — Deep Lab B: Digital Timing Micro-lab

Lab (110 min)
- Implement 4-bit ripple-carry adder and 4-bit carry-lookahead adder in
  logisim-evolution.
- Measure propagation delays via toggled inputs; record stabilization time.

Acceptance
- Report measured delays; screenshots; compare ripple vs. CLA.

Reading (20 min)
- Revisit gate depth → critical path.

Debugging (30 min)
- Verify consistent stimuli; repeatability.

Reflection (20 min)
- Explain why CLA is faster; connect to CPU critical path.
