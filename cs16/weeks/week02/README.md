# Week 02 — Sequential Logic, Machine Language, Induction & Recurrences

Resources
- Nand2Tetris: Ch. 3–4 (sequential logic; machine language)
- 6.042J: Ch. 4 (induction), Ch. 7.1 (recurrences)
- K&R: §5.1–5.6 (pointers/arrays)

Outcomes
- Build registers, RAM hierarchy, and PC.
- Write Hack assembly; prove loop invariants.
- Solve basic recurrences.

Exit Criteria
- N2T RAM and PC tests pass.
- Assembly programs pass scripted tests.

Retrieval Bank
1) Loop invariant for array-sum (correctness proof).
2) Hazard if chaining DFFs without proper clocking; metastability.
3) Interaction of PC, instruction mem, data mem each cycle.
4) Solve T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n (Θ(n log n)).
5) Derive cost (cycles) for shift-add multiply on Hack with costs M, A.
