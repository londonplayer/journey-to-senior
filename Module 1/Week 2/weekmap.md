Week 2 — Sequential logic; timing; intro to proofs by contradiction

- Readings
  - DDCA Ch. 3–4. N2T Projects 2–3 specs.
  - MIT 6.042J: Predicates, sets, proof by contradiction.
- Labs - W2-A Sequential/timing: DFF from latches; 16-bit register; PC; Reg→ALU→Reg pipeline toy. - Acceptance: timing diagrams show setup/hold; PC increments/jumps for 20-step script. - Micro-Lab ML1 (Mon): Falstad RC delay and noise margins. - Acceptance: plot \(t\_{pd}\) vs C; relate to fan-out.
