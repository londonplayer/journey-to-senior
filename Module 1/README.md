# Module 1 (Weeks 1–2): Bits → gates → CPU (and physics underpinnings)

- Resources: Harris & Harris DDCA; Nand2Tetris (Part I).
- Outcomes: logic levels; combinational/sequential circuits; timing diagrams; metastability basics; simple ALU/PC in Logisim.
- Exit: pass truth-table/timing tests; whiteboard “bit rides on physics.”
- Cross-links: RC delay ↔ frequency; energy vs performance.
