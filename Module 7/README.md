# Module 7 (Weeks 13–14): Data systems + probabilistic structures

- Resources: DDIA; Mitzenmacher & Upfal (Bloom filters).
- Outcomes: log-structured KV with WAL + compaction + Bloom; snapshot reads.
- Exit: crash-recovery passes; FPR target met; oral “LSM vs B+tree.”
- Cross-links: Bloom FP rate ↔ tail bounds; batching ↔ queueing.
